Cmd steps:
=>go to particular env in cmd
=>give goto admin
=>sudo su -
=>pvs 		                          ( Its shows physical volumes, logical volumes, fmt values)
=>df -hT 	                          ( It shows  type of file system, size, used, avail , mountpoints of file systems)
=>pvresize <device name> 	  ( Resizes PhysicalVolume which may already be in a volume group and have active logical volumes allocated on it )
             example: pvresize /dev/xvdh
=>lvextend -L <+amount of size to increased> <file-system> 	( To increase the logical volume with respect to the file system )

=>xfs_growfs <mount point>       ( To increase the size of an XFS file system with mount point)
